## Introduction

Danny is a die-hard fan of Japanese cuisine and in early 2021 decided to launch a cozy restaurant offering his three favorite dishes: **sushi**, **curry**, and **ramen**.

Although the food has heart, the business needs help, Danny has gathered some basic transactional data but lacks the skills to extract meaningful insights. That‚Äôs where this case study begins.

As part of my data analyst portfolio, this project demonstrates how SQL can be used to support business decisions in the restaurant industry.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Danny is interested in understanding customer behavior to improve operations and customer retention. Specifically, he wants to uncover:

- How often customers visit
- What they order most frequently
- How much they‚Äôve spent
- How effective the current loyalty program has been

With these insights, he hopes to enhance the dining experience and decide whether to expand his loyalty rewards system.

## üßæ Datasets Used

Three key tables form the foundation of this case study:

- `sales`: Records each customer's order history including `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`
- `menu`: Maps each `product_id` to its `product_name` and `price`
- `members`: Tracks when each customer joined the loyalty program via `join_date`
