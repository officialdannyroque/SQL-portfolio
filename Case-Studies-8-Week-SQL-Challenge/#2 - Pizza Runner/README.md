## 🧠 Introduction

While diving deep into SQL and business analytics, I came across a fictional startup that instantly grabbed my attention: **Pizza Runner** – a retro-themed pizza delivery service with a startup twist. The concept wasn’t just pizza, but pizza with a platform-based model (think Uber for pizza).

As someone who’s passionate about startups, strategy, and data, I found this case study the perfect way to simulate real-world thinking: logistics, optimization, customer experience, and even pricing strategy. This project goes beyond querying — it's about business intelligence through SQL.

## 📦 Dataset

The Pizza Runner case study includes 6 tables:

- **`runners`**: Stores registration dates for each runner.
- **`customer_orders`**: Captures each pizza ordered, along with custom exclusions and extras.
- **`runner_orders`**: Links runners to each order, including timing, distance, and delivery status.
- **`pizza_names`**: Contains the two pizza types: Meat Lovers and Vegetarian.
- **`pizza_recipes`**: Lists default ingredients for each pizza.
- **`pizza_toppings`**: Maps topping IDs to topping names.
