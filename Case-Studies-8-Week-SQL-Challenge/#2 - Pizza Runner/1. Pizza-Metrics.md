## Solutions:

---

### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas 
FROM   customer_orders;
```

#### Result set:

| num_pizzas |
| ---------- |
| 14         |

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS distinct_order_count 
FROM   customer_orders;
```

#### Result set:

| distinct_order_count |
| -------------------- |
| 10                   | 

---

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
-- Logic: Group By runner_id and add up orders that did not result in cancellation

SELECT   runner_id, SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_delivered
FROM     temp_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

---

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT 	   pizza_name, SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_delivered
FROM 	   temp_runner_orders r
INNER JOIN temp_customer_orders c ON r.order_id = c.order_id
INNER JOIN pizza_names p ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
GROUP BY   pizza_name;
```

#### Result set:

| pizza_name | orders_delivered |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Vegetarian | 3                |
| Meatlovers | 9                |

---

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

```sql
SELECT 	   c.customer_id, p.pizza_name, COUNT(c.order_id) AS num_orders
FROM 	   temp_runner_orders r
INNER JOIN temp_customer_orders c ON r.order_id = c.order_id
INNER JOIN pizza_names p ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
GROUP BY   p.pizza_name, c.customer_id
ORDER BY   customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | pizza_name | num_orders |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2          |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2          |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 3          |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1          |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3          |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1          |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

```sql
SELECT order_id, COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY num_pizzas DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | num_pizzas |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4        | 3          |

---

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
-- orders_with_change means either one value in exclusions or extras IS NULL within a row
-- orders_without_change means within a row, both values for exclusion and extras must be NULL

SELECT c.customer_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_with_change,
       SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_without_change
FROM   temp_customer_orders c
INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r
ON 	   c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE 	   cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY   c.customer_id
ORDER BY   c.customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | orders_with_change | orders_without_change  |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 101         | 0                  | 2                      |
| 102         | 0                  | 3                      |
| 103         | 3                  | 0                      |
| 104         | 2                  | 1                      |
| 105         | 1                  | 0                      |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

```sql
-- changes_in_both requires that both exclusions and extras values within a single row are NOT NULL

SELECT     c.customer_id,
           SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS changes_in_both
FROM       temp_customer_orders c
INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE      cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY   c.customer_id
ORDER BY   c.customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | changes_in_both |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 101         | 0               |
| 102         | 0               |
| 103         | 0               |
| 104         | 1               |
| 105         | 0               |

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

```sql
SELECT   EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) AS order_hour, COUNT(order_id) AS num_orders
FROM     temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY order_hour
ORDER BY order_hour;
```

#### Result set:

| order_hour | num_orders |
|------------|------------|
| 11         | 1          |
| 13         | 3          |
| 18         | 3          |
| 19         | 1          |
| 21         | 3          |
| 23         | 3          |

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

```sql
 SELECT TO_CHAR(order_time, 'Day') AS day_of_week,
        COUNT(*) AS order_volume
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY order_volume DESC;
```

#### Result set:

| day_of_week | order_volume |
|-------------|--------------|
| Saturday    | 5            |
| Wednesday   | 5            |
