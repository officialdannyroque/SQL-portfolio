## Case Study Questions - Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## Solutions :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using `PostgreSQL v15` on [Runner & Customer Experience - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/qXfAwWaJspvMVK4rwCNTie/26).

### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM registration_date) AS week_number,
       COUNT(runner_id) AS runners_count
FROM runners
GROUP BY week_number
ORDER BY week_number;
```

#### Result set:

| week_number | runners_count |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 53          | 2             |

---

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

```sql
SELECT     r.runner_id, ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CAST(pickup_time AS TIMESTAMP) - order_time)) / 60), 2) avg_min_to_arrival
FROM       temp_customer_orders c
INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE      r.pickup_time IS NOT NULL AND r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY   r.runner_id
ORDER BY   runner_id;


-- remarks :
-- The EXTRACT function with EPOCH is used to convert the time interval into total seconds.
-- Dividing the result by 60 gives us the duration in minutes.
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | avg_min_to_arrival |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1         | 15.68              |
| 3         | 10.47              |
| 2         | 23.72              |

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

```sql
WITH prep AS (SELECT c.order_id, COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizza,
	  	     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CAST(pickup_time AS TIMESTAMP) - order_time)) / 60) avg_prep_time
	      FROM temp_customer_orders c
	      INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r
	      ON c.order_id = r.order_id
	      WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL AND order_time IS NOT NULL AND cancellation IS NULL
	      GROUP BY c.order_id
	      ORDER BY order_id)


SELECT num_pizza, ROUND(AVG(avg_prep_time)) AS avg_prep_time
FROM   prep
GROUP BY num_pizza

-- remarks:
-- with this querie we can analyze how cook times for an order changes with the number of pizzas ordered
-- we can observe here that a second pizza only adds about 6 minutes to cook time but a third adds 11
-- but still adheres to economies of scale given that it takes less than cooking the initial pizza (12.36 min)
```

#### Result set:

| pizzas_order_count | time_for_prep |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| 1                  | 12.36         |
| 2                  | 18.38         |
| 3                  | 29.28         |

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

```sql
SELECT 	   customer_id, ROUND(AVG(distance_km::FLOAT)) AS avg_distance_km
FROM 	   temp_customer_orders c
INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r
ON 	   c.order_id = r.order_id
GROUP BY   customer_id
ORDER BY   customer_id
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | avg_distance_km  |
|-------------|------------------|
| 101         | 20               |
| 102         | 17               |
| 103         | 23               |
| 104         | 10               |
| 105         | 25               |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

```sql
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS maximum_difference
FROM   temp_runner_orders
```

#### Result set:


maximum_difference |
--|
30

---

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

```sql
SELECT r.runner_id, c.order_id, AVG(duration_mins::FLOAT) avg_duration_mins
FROM temp_customer_orders c
INNER JOIN temp_runner_orders r
ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE duration_mins IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY r.runner_id, c.order_id
ORDER BY runner_id, order_id


-- remarks: 

-- as each runner gains more experience delivering order, there delivery time is decreasing.
-- they are learning how to be more efficient on their delivery routes
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | order_id | avg_duration_mins |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 1        | 32                |
| 1         | 2        | 27                |
| 1         | 3        | 20                |
| 1         | 10       | 10                |
| 2         | 4        | 40                |
| 2         | 7        | 25                |
| 2         | 8        | 15                |
| 3         | 5        | 15                |

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

```sql
SELECT   runner_id, SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS delivery_completed, COUNT(*) AS assigned_deliveries, 
	 ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*)) AS completion_pct
FROM     temp_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id
```

#### Result set:


| runner_id | delivery_completed | assigned_deliveries | completion_pct  |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1         | 4                  | 4                    | 100            |
| 2         | 3                  | 4                    | 75             |
| 3         | 1                  | 2                    | 50             |
