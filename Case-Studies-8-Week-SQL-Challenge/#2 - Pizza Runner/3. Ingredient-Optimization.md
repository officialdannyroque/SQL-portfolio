### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```sql
WITH 

exploded_toppings AS (SELECT pizza_id, CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(toppings, ',')) AS INTEGER) AS topping_id
		      FROM pizza_recipes),

recipes AS (SELECT et.pizza_id, et.topping_id, pt.topping_name
	    FROM exploded_toppings et
	    LEFT JOIN pizza_toppings pt
	    ON et.topping_id = pt.topping_id)

SELECT    r.pizza_id, pizza_name, topping_id, topping_name
FROM 	  recipes r
LEFT JOIN pizza_names pn
ON r.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
```

**Explanation:**

This query transforms a denormalized toppings list into a clear, structured output by:

Exploding the comma-separated topping IDs for each pizza

Mapping each topping ID to its name

Joining with pizza names to make the output human-readable

This enables stakeholders to:

Quickly understand each pizzaâ€™s composition

Identify common ingredients across pizzas

Support menu decisions, inventory planning, and marketing content creation

#### Result set:

| pizza_id | pizza_name | topping_id | topping_name |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 2          | BBQ Sauce    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 8          | Pepperoni    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 4          | Cheese       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 10         | Salami       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 5          | Chicken      |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 1          | Bacon        |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 3          | Beef         |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 12         | Tomato Sauce |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 4          | Cheese       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 7          | Onions       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 9          | Peppers      |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 11         | Tomatoes     |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```sql
WITH top_topping AS 

(SELECT CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(extras, ',')) AS INTEGER) AS extras_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM temp_customer_orders c
GROUP BY extras_id
ORDER BY frequency DESC 
LIMIT 1)

SELECT 	   topping_name, frequency
FROM 	   top_topping tt
INNER JOIN pizza_toppings pt
ON 	   tt.extras_id = pt.topping_id
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Bacon        | 4         |

---

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

```sql
WITH exclusion_freq AS

(SELECT CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(exclusions, ',')) AS INTEGER) AS exclusion_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY exclusion_id)

SELECT topping_name, frequency
FROM exclusion_freq ef
INNER JOIN pizza_toppings pt
ON ef.exclusion_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Cheese       | 4         |

---

### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the `customers_orders` table in the format of one of the following:

- `Meat Lovers`

- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
- `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

```sql
WITH

exploded_exclusions AS (SELECT order_id,
		               CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(exclusions, ',')) AS INTEGER) AS exclusion_id
		        FROM temp_customer_orders
			WHERE exclusions IS NOT NULL),

exclusion_names AS (SELECT e.order_id, STRING_AGG(topping_name, ', ') AS exclusions
				FROM exploded_exclusions e
				INNER JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON
				e.exclusion_id = pt.topping_id
				GROUP BY order_id),

exploded_extras AS (SELECT order_id,
		           CAST(UNNEST(string_to_array(extras, ',')) AS INTEGER) AS extra_id
		    FROM temp_customer_orders),

extra_names AS (SELECT order_id,
			STRING_AGG(topping_name, ', ') AS toppings
		FROM exploded_extras ee
		INNER JOIN pizza_toppings pt
		ON ee.extra_id = pt.topping_id
		GROUP BY ee.order_id)

SELECT co.order_id, co.customer_id, pn.pizza_name ||
	   CASE WHEN co.extras IS NOT NULL THEN ' - Extra ' || en.toppings ELSE '' END ||
	   CASE WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL THEN ' - Exclude ' || exn.exclusions ELSE '' END
FROM temp_customer_orders co
LEFT JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
LEFT JOIN extra_names en ON co.order_id = en.order_id
LEFT JOIN exclusion_names exn ON co.order_id = exn.order_id
ORDER BY order_id, customer_id;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | customer_id | order_description                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |
| 2        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |

### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.

For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`

```sql
WITH Ingredients AS (
    SELECT    co.order_id,
              co.pizza_id,
              pt.topping_name,
              CASE
                  WHEN pt.topping_id = ANY(string_to_array(co.extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) THEN '2x' || pt.topping_name
                  ELSE pt.topping_name
              END AS ingredient_with_extra
    FROM      temp_customer_orders co CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array((SELECT toppings FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes WHERE pizza_id = co.pizza_id), ',')::INTEGER[]) AS r(topping_id)
        JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt USING(topping_id)
    GROUP BY  1, 2, 3, pt.topping_id, co.extras
),
AggregatedIngredients AS (
    SELECT   order_id,
             pizza_id,
             STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ingredient_with_extra, ', ' ORDER BY ingredient_with_extra) AS ingredients
    FROM     Ingredients
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   ai.order_id,
         CONCAT(pn.pizza_name, ': ',  ai.ingredients) AS order_description
FROM     AggregatedIngredients ai JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
ORDER BY 1
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ingredients CTE**:

  - This part generates a list of all ingredients for each pizza, marking those that are also listed as extras with "2x".

  - The `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` with `unnest` is used to expand the toppings listed in `pizza_recipes` into individual rows, which are then joined with `pizza_toppings` to get the topping names.

  - Ingredients that are extras have "2x" prefixed directly.

- **AggregatedIngredients CTE**:

  - Aggregates the ingredients (including "2x" prefixed extras) for each order into a single, alphabetically ordered string.

  - `DISTINCT` inside `STRING_AGG` ensures no duplicate ingredient listings, addressing cases where an ingredient might be listed both as a base ingredient and an extra.

- **Final SELECT**: Constructs the final output by combining the pizza name with the aggregated ingredient list, ordered by `order_id`.

#### Result set:

| order_id | order_description                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 2        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 3        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 3        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 4        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 4        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 5        | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                  |
| 6        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 7        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 8        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 9        | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xChicken, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                |
| 10       | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xCheese, BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |

### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

```sql
WITH BaseIngredients as (
    SELECT   pt.topping_id,
             COUNT(*) as base_count 
    FROM     pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = ANY(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[])
    GROUP BY 1
), Extras as (
    SELECT   unnest(string_to_array(co.extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) as topping_id,
             COUNT(*) as extra_count
    FROM     temp_customer_orders co
    WHERE    co.extras <> '' AND co.extras IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
), TotalIngredients as (
    SELECT   topping_id,
             (COALESCE(base_count, 0) + COALESCE(extra_count, 0)) as total_count
    FROM     BaseIngredients FULL OUTER JOIN Extras USING(topping_id)
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name,
         ti.total_count
FROM     TotalIngredients ti JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ti.topping_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:


topping_name |	total_count |
--|--|
Bacon |	5 |
Cheese |	3 |
Mushrooms |	2 |
Chicken |	2 |
Pepperoni |	1 |
Peppers |	1 |
Salami |	1 |
Tomatoes |	1 |
Tomato Sauce |	1 |
BBQ Sauce |	1 |
